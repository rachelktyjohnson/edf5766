                The adoption of the 5-stage Design Thinking framework to uncover a solution was a strategic choice as its values and strength alignment with our objectives. This framework, comprising of the Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test stages (Dam, 2023), is acknowledged for its versatility, problem-solving efficacy, and human-centred approach (Krohn & Meinel, 2022), which resonate with the unique challenges we aimed to address.

            <h3 id="why-design-thinking">Why Design Thinking</h3>
            <p>
                The strength of Design Thinking lies in its capacity to explore an array of tools and thinking protocols centred on meeting human needs and desires (Koh et al., 2015). This alignment with our objective to improve student motivation and practice positions Design Thinking as a fitting approach. Design thinking is inherently user-centred, putting the user at the core of the design process, ensuring that products and services are designed to meet their needs (Razzouk & Shute, 2012)
            </p>
            <p>
                This shift in perspective transforms the traditional model of learning into a dynamic, two-way exchange of ideas and solutions. The flexibility of Design Thinking enables us to tailor our approach to the specific needs and desires of students, ensuring a comprehensive solution that resonates with them. It's a model that places the diverse needs of our students at the forefront, shaping a solution that fosters their love for music and empowers them as active participants.
            </p>
            <p>
                Henderson (2023) underscores that Design Thinking is an optimal selection when there is ample time, a creative team, and the freedom to experiment. Given our autonomy as the sole stakeholders, our capacity for experimentation, and a flexible timeframe, the conditions are ideal. Furthermore, with a student body exceeding 100, we are well-positioned to attract creative minds for this design solution. Therefore, Design Thinking emerges as a fitting choice for our endeavour.
            </p>
            <h2 id="examples-in-literature">Examples in Literature</h2>
            <p>
                Design Thinking has been used in education, targeting the creative minds of students to develop new educational products or resources, design solutions to real-world problems, improve the design of the school or classroom, and plan and implement school-wide projects. Some case studies outlined by Meinel and Krohn (2022) and Koh et al. (2015) include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Design of a new school building</li>
                <li>Development of a new educational app</li>
                <li>Redesign of a schoolyard</li>
                <li>Planning and implementation of a school-wide project</li>
                <li>Development of a new science curriculum</li>
                <li>Design of a new playground</li>
                <li>Creation of a student-led social enterprise</li>
                <li>Redesign of a school library</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                While all these case studies offered valuable insights into the Design Thinking process, we opted to delve deeper into those that did not culminate in a tangible structure or object.

                After conducting a literature review and a comparative analysis of Design Thinking applications in various educational settings, the next step is to adapt these insights to our context. Leveraging the identified action points, including those tailored to my unique circumstances, the "Process" section of this website both outlines and substantiates our adoption of the Design Thinking framework to come up with wicked solution

            <p>
                Due to the unique nature of my context, my application of the Design Thinking framework differs slightly to the examples found. However, it retains the fundamental five core stages while incorporating additional elements, organised into three distinct sections of the design process.
