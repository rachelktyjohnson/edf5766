            <p>
                In the realm of education technology, we encounter challenges and debates that are instrumental in shaping the future of digital learning. The first challenge we confront pertains to digital literacy and access. How can we ensure that all students, irrespective of their digital literacy level or access to the internet, can actively participate in the ideation of communication methods and information hubs? Our solution to this challenge is twofold. First, we propose offering digital literacy guidance for stakeholders who require it, thus fostering inclusivity and enhancing their digital proficiency. Secondly, we advocate for alternative offline channels and methods of access for individuals with limited internet connectivity. By providing equitable opportunities for engagement, we strive to create a level playing field for all.

                The pilot program culminates with a live ensemble performance viewing through YouTube Premiere. The timing is strategically set to accommodate both students at home and those still at school. While some students may gather in person to watch, YouTube Premiere ensures a collective viewing experience, simulating the atmosphere of a live concert where everyone can enjoy the performances together.

            <p>As always technology-related challenges emerge in this stage. One such challenge is dogital feedback literacy. This challenge underscores the importance of participants' digital literacy when using the feedback collection system. Stakeholders may possess varying levels of comfort with digital platforms, which could influence the quality and quantity of feedback. Our solution is to provide digital literacy support to all stakeholders if required, ensuring that they can effectively use the system. Participants can then contribute meaningfully to the program's feedback process.</p>
            <p>Another challenge that emerges is admin managing data overload. With the continuous data collection from multiple sources, the program may encounter difficulties in managing and processing the substantial amount of feedback and assessment data. To address this, I will implementing data management tools and practices. These tools will efficiently collect, store, analyse, and report on the data gathered during the pilot run. This organized approach allows for a more streamlined and effective utilisation of the extensive data collected.</p>
            <p>Lastly, there's the challenge of access to YouTube to watch the premiere. It is essential to acknowledge that not all students may have easy access to this online platform from their homes. Recognising the diversity in students' internet access and device availability is crucial. The solution is to make the video accessible on YouTube after the initial premiere. This approach provides students with the flexibility to watch the performance at a time that suits them. Additionally, teachers can integrate the video into their lessons, offering students the opportunity to discuss and analyse the performance during their regular class time. This flexibility ensures that access to educational content is inclusive, considering the unique circumstances of all students.</p>
