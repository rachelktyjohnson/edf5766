            <p>
                The Empathise stage has been fulfilled, and in adherence to the iterative nature of the Design Thinking framework, I anticipate revisiting this stage when necessary. In fact, my plan entails an ongoing process of empathising with stakeholders throughout the entire design journey. The following serves as a record of the activities completed thus far.
            </p>
            <h3 id="stakeholder-conversations">Stakeholder Conversations</h3>
            <p>
                In my role as the school administrator and receptionist, I have had the opportunity to engage in substantial conversations with guardians while their students are in class. These candid and insightful discussions have been easily accessible due to the trust that guardians place in my commitment to improving the school and student experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, both I and my fellow teachers share a personal rapport with our students within the classroom setting. These students confide in us with their unfiltered opinions, and many express their thoughts openly when requested.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the past several months, I have engaged in candid dialogues with students and guardians alike, exploring topics of practice, motivation, and expectations. This process has enabled us to gain a comprehensive understanding of our stakeholders, documenting their needs, desires, and pain points. However, drawing from my experience in User Experience (UX) design, I have learned that what participants say may not always unveil their underlying sentiments. Therefore, we rely on an additional method of empathy.
            </p>
            <h3 id="user-observation">User Observation</h3>
            <p>
                As educators, our vigilance extends beyond the technical correctness of scales and musical pieces. This heightened attention has been particularly pronounced in recent months as we've undertaken the observation of our students through the lens of our wicked problem. Drawing from my background in UX design, I am aware that participants' behaviours, actions, and reactions frequently offer invaluable insights into their underlying needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, we've observed the interactions between students and their guardians in the music school setting. We've evaluated the extent to which students communicate about their lessons with their guardians, the degree of inquisitiveness exhibited by the guardians, the level of enthusiasm with which lesson content is discussed, and other aspects.
            </p>
            <p>
                While this data has been recorded, it is accompanied assumptions of its deeper significance, an interpretation substantiated by data derived from informal conversations.
            </p>
            <h3 id="analyse-data">Analyse Data</h3>
            <p>
                The raw data gathered was then handled using some UX tools and techniques.
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Affinity Mapping</th>
                    <td>This is a technique for grouping related data points into clusters. This was helpful for identifying key themes and insights in the data</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Card Sorting</th>
                    <td>This is a technique for asking users to group related items together. This was helpful for understanding how users categorise information and for identifying the most important features and functionality.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>User Journey Mapping</th>
                    <td>This is a technique for visualising the steps that users take to achieve a goal. This was helpful for identifying the user's needs and pain points at each stage of the journey.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>User Personas</th>
                    <td>These are created by combining quantitative data with qualitative data to create a realistic and detailed representation of a target user.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>The findings from these UX methods allowed us to systematically gather data on the stakeholder experience regarding motivation and practice.</p>
            <h2 id="define">Define</h2>
            <p>
                The Define stage has also been fulfilled. As previously emphasised, given the iterative nature of Design Thinking, we maintain an flexible approach and are prepared to revisit and refine definitions as required.
            </p>
            <h3 id="data-driven-insights">Data Driven Insights</h3>
            <h4 id="fading-aspirations">Fading Aspirations</h4>
            <p>
                Our data shows that, initially, students start learning with genuine interest but later feel restricted by their choice, leading to a decline in motivation. Students often initiate their learning journey by observing others, often through YouTube. However, the aspiration to become YouTube performers fades as they encounter basic lessons and less engaging songs. Our students are not alone in this phenomenon, as similar experiences are recorded in literature (Gaffe, 1990; Lambshead, 2002; MacIntyre et al., 2018; McHugh, 2016; Rife et al., 2001, Schatt, 2023)
            </p>
            <h4 id="costly-performance-opportunities">Costly Performance Opportunities</h4>
            <p>
                As we near our year-end concert, a significant observation stands out: students' practice and motivation rise when preparing their chosen pieces. These selections are often made collaboratively with students to ensure ongoing passion. Gaffe (1990) states that recitals lead to improved attitudes, successes, motivation for future goals, and boosted self-esteem. This is reflected in our observations, where the prospect of performing in front of peers and family appears to be a powerful motivator.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, organising concerts historically posed challenges for us. Our concerts prioritise enriching the experience for students over profitability, often resulting in financial losses. As a result, the school is limited to one concert per year. Only 42% of students chose not to participate this year, with a standout reason being that they didn't enjoy the instrument enough to work towards a goal "that far away". Perhaps this could be mitigated with more frequent performance opportunities.
            </p>
            <h4 id="ensemble-scheduling-pains">Ensemble Scheduling Pains</h4>
            <p>
                Ensembles foster a common goal, accomplishment, and unity through collaboration. They enhance communication skills, promote participation, improve self-confidence, and empower students (Hanrahan, 2018). However, most students and guardians are available only one day a week. Even students who attend the same school face this scheduling challenge within school hours (Cayari, 2015), making it particularly challenging for us.
            </p>
            <p>
                While ensembles have the potential to foster shared accomplishment and unity, a challenge lies in accommodating the schedules our students and their guardians.
            </p>
            <h3 id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h3>
            <p>
                In response to the challenges identified in private music education, we introduce a hybrid ensemble program designed by all stakeholders. This solution embraces a combination of elements aimed at rekindling student motivation and practice habits, offering more accessible performance opportunities, promoting a sense of unity and shared accomplishment, and most importantly is largely determined by the stakeholder. It's key components include the following points. Consistent with the principles of Design Thinking, this proposed solution remains open to evolution as we progress through subsequent stages that actively involves stakeholders.
            </p>
            <h4 id="hybrid-ensembles">Hybrid Ensembles</h4>
            <p>
                Students will work on and film their parts during regular lessons. This approach allows students to collaborate seamlessly without extensive additional scheduling and provides an inclusive platform for diverse performances.
            </p>
            <h4 id="virtual-performance-opportunities">Virtual Performance Opportunities</h4>
            <p>
                Through online platforms, such as the aforementioned favourite, YouTube, students can participate in virtual performances, reaching a broader audience while maintaining their motivation and aspirations to showcase their musical talents. This concept has been addressed and explored in scholarly works, including Savage (2017) and Cayari (2015, 2018, 2021).
            </p>
            <h4 id="stakeholder-collaboration">Stakeholder Collaboration</h4>
            <p>
                The program will be developed collaboratively alongside students and guardian stakeholders, ensuring that their input is incorporated into the design and implementation of the initiative.
            </p>
            <h4 id="leveraging-technology">Leveraging Technology</h4>
            <p>
                We will utilise music notation software, backing tracks, audio/video post-production software, and YouTube throughout the entire process, from conception and practice to filming and the final presentation. Students will actively participate in each step, gaining valuable skills in music technologies.
            </p>
            <h2 id="recruitment">Recruitment</h2>
            <h3 id="dedicated-website">Dedicated Website</h3>
            <p>
                In our pursuit of inclusive and student-centric music education, we have developed a dedicated website that serves as an information hub for our Hybrid Ensemble Program. This website is designed to provide prospective student participants and their guardians with comprehensive insights into the program's design process, its objectives, and the expected outcomes over two terms.
            </p>
            <h3 id="empowering-stakeholders">Empowering Stakeholders</h3>
            <p>By offering a clear and detailed overview of the program's timeline, activities, and objectives, the website empowers potential participants to make informed decisions regarding their involvement. Students, in particular, gain a comprehensive understanding of the responsibilities, opportunities, and expectations associated with their role as design team members.</p>
            <p>This transparent approach to communication ensures that all stakeholders, including guardians, can appreciate the value and implications of the program. It enables them to consider the level of commitment and engagement they wish to undertake and make informed choices that align with their individual aspirations and interests.</p>
            <p>The website serves as a vital tool in our commitment to transparency, engagement, and inclusive decision-making for all individuals involved in the design solution process.</p>
            <h3 id="technology-challenges">Technology Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                Within the domain of education technology, we encounter challenges and engage in critical debates that influence our approach to digital solutions. The first challenge at hand is the conundrum of Digital Inclusion vs. Exclusion. This dilemma revolves around ensuring that the website mentioned above is accessible to all while steering clear of unintentional exclusion. To address this, we propose implementing web accessibility standards, such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), to ensure that the site is fully accessible to individuals with disabilities. Practical measures include using alt text for images, guaranteeing keyboard navigation, and providing options for users to adjust text size and contrast.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another issue is the idea of being overwhelmed by information. Striking a balance between providing comprehensive information and avoiding overwhelming visitors is a paramount concern. Our solution is rooted in the art of effective content organisation. By arranging content logically, we aim to make information consumption more manageable. Additionally, we focus on creating a site structure that allows visitors to easily locate the information they seek, minimising the risk of information overload.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final challenge centres on the tug-of-war between online engagement vs. in-person interaction. Achieving a balance between the website and in-person interaction is imporant. To address this, we advocate a hybrid approach. The website serves as a platform for providing essential information and resources, ensuring online engagement is a valuable and effective component. However, it is essential to offer opportunities for in-person meetings and communication, as there is no replacement for the richness of in-person interaction. We consider the website as a supplementary tool.
            </p>
            <h2 id="prototype">Prototype</h2>
            <p>
                The Prototype stage underscores the importance of iteration, encouraging experimentation and rapid learning to refine the program's components before entering the testing phase (Koh et al, 2015; Meinel & Krohn, 2022).
            </p>
            <p>
                In the Prototype stage, spanning from week 1 to week 10, the collaborative effort of students, teachers, guardians, and administrators continues to transform theoretical concepts into functional program elements. These prototypes will be documented in the information hub decided upon in the previous stage.
            </p>
            <p>
                In line with the guiding principle of failing often and early (Liedtka et al., 2013), students will collaboratively craft and prototype essential program components with their guiding teachers:
